Each one of the stars above and, in fact, almost everything else around you, yourself
included, is just made up of those two quarks.

<P2 mb={30}>
Quarks have a bit of a weird charge. 2/3 for the up quark and -1/3 for the down one. You can
remember that "up" means positive and "down" means negative, and also that "up" means more
of charge than the "down".
</P2>
<P2 mb={50}>
So if you take two "up" quarks and one "down" quark you get a +1 positively charged
particle, you get a proton. If you take two "down" quarks and one "up" then you get a
neutron, a neutrally charged particle.

Etymologically "protos" means "first", and that is a fitting name for the essentially first
kind of particle in the universe. Take that proton and let it float in a never-ending void,
this is what the universe is, mostly, a collection of protons. We call it hydrogen (We're
simplifying a bit here). The quarks inside a proton are held together by the stong force,
and actually that force sort of leaks out beyond the inner quarks, such that two protons
would actually bind together were they not both positively charged.

But they are both positively changed and hence they repel. However, if you were to squeeze
two protons together, once sufficient force is present, one of those inner "up" quarks would
turn into a "down" quark (don't ask me how, that probably requires a PhD) and that means
that the proton would become a neutron (an extra charged particle is created for this
process to conserve the overall charge). -1/2 -1/2 +2/3 = 0 charge - a neutrally charged
particle. Neutron from the word "neutral". In this case there would be no repeling charge
forces, so the proton and the neutron would bind together.

In this case we would have a hydrogen with an extra neutron which we call hydrogen-2 or
deuterium (deu meaning 2). You can add another proton and the leaking strong force will
still overcome the repelling force of the two protons and you will have a two proton one
neutron particle we call helium-3, which is just one neutron shy of its most stable form
helium-4 or just helium.

<P2>
Other combinations like Helium-2 or Hydrogen-4 or even double neutron particles are also
possible, but most would decay about as fast a photon of light would travel across the
nucleus. If you wanted to observe such a particle, say you could accelerate and colide large
nucleuses of atoms or have a very large atom decay into smaller parts. You would not even be
able to detect it with a detector as it would not exist long enough to get to it. You would
have to infer its existance from the scatering of other particles.

<P2 mb={50}>
So there you go, protons and neutrons mixing to create mostly hydrogen and helium. That's
how everything starts. A cloud of hydrogen and helium contracts under gravity until its
dense enough to create a proto-star, basically something like saturn, only without all of
the heavier elements. Add more hydrogen till its gravity crushes it so much that the created
heat and pressure stars fusing together the protons and you have a shining star. Let that
star die, meaning its fusion stops and before it dies gravity will compress even further and
then it will either stay crushed or explode creating all of the heavier elements that we so
dearly rely on: oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and many others (all heavier elements above helium
are refered to as metals in this context and their presense is refered to as metalicity).
</P2>
<H2 mb={100}>
All of those new elements, still just a collection of protons and neutrons, which are made
out of those two elementary particles: "up" and "down" quarks.

<H4>Extra fact:</H4>
<P2>
Recently an AI was trained to reevaluate all of the 30 years of data that particle
accelerators have collected around the world and create thousands of models that would try
to fit that data to come up with the best model for a proton. The conclution, with a pretty high certainty was that the proton sometimes behaves as if it was made up of 3 quarks and sometimes as if it was made up of 5 quarks. Two "up", two "down" and one "strange" quark. The strange quark is a bit like the down quark, but a bit heavier.
